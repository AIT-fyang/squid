Sandbox
Is a testing environment that isolate untested code changes and outright experimentation from production environment or repository.

The concept of sandbox(also called a working directory, a test server or development server), is typically build into revision control software such as CVS and SVN, in which developers “check out” a copy of the source code, only after the developer has fully tested the code changes in their own sandbox should the changes be checked back into the merged with the repository and thereby made available to other developers or end users of the software.
