-- 15digit vs digits ID
extra 3 digits of 18 bits id are checksum.
use 15 digits in validation rules and through API.
API will accept the 15 digits ID as Input but will always return 18 digit ID.

-- bulk API is REST-based API
it has no limit of records, but no of batches per day.
2000 batches per 24 hours

-- Too many SOQL queries 101: 100 query in context including trigger
-- Too many query rows: more than 2000 records returned(reference guide) 
50001?

good practice:
https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=System-LimitException-Too-many-SOQL-queries-101&language=en_US
move soql out of loop

-- batch limit 0-200
Database.Execute(batchable, limit);

-- Select count() from lead

--validation rule, check picklist
ISPICKVAL(field, value)
